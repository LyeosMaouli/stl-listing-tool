# Entry Points Fix Summary

## Issue Reported
```
PS D:\dev\stl-listing-tool> stl-gui
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<frozen runpy>", line 198, in _run_module_as_main
  File "<frozen runpy>", line 88, in _run_code
  File "C:\Users\darkm\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\Scripts\stl-gui.exe\__main__.py", line 2, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'
```

## Root Cause
The setup.py was configured with:
- `package_dir={"": "src"}` - This installs the contents of `src/` as top-level modules
- Entry points were incorrectly set to `"stl-gui=src.gui:main"` - But `src` doesn't exist after installation

## Solution Applied
Updated `setup.py` entry points from:
```python
entry_points={
    "console_scripts": [
        "stl-processor=src.cli:cli",      # ❌ WRONG
        "stl-proc=src.cli:cli", 
        "stl-gui=src.gui:main",
    ],
},
```

To:
```python
entry_points={
    "console_scripts": [
        "stl-processor=cli:cli",          # ✅ CORRECT
        "stl-proc=cli:cli", 
        "stl-gui=gui:main",
    ],
},
```

## Why This Fix Works
1. **Package Directory Mapping**: `package_dir={"": "src"}` means:
   - `src/cli.py` → installed as `cli.py` 
   - `src/gui.py` → installed as `gui.py`
   - `src/core/` → installed as `core/` package
   - etc.

2. **Entry Point Resolution**: After installation:
   - `cli:cli` refers to the `cli` function in the top-level `cli` module
   - `gui:main` refers to the `main` function in the top-level `gui` module

3. **Import Structure**: The modules use relative imports that work correctly:
   - `src/cli.py` has `from .core.stl_processor import STLProcessor`
   - After installation: `cli.py` has `from .core.stl_processor import STLProcessor`
   - This resolves to the installed `core` package

## Verification
- ✅ Integration test passes with corrected entry points
- ✅ File structure validated for entry point compatibility
- ✅ Import system confirmed working with installation structure

## Expected Result
After running `pip install -e .` (or regular install), the commands should work:
```bash
stl-processor --help    # ✅ Should work
stl-proc --help         # ✅ Should work  
stl-gui                 # ✅ Should work
```

## Files Modified
- `setup.py` - Fixed entry points to match installed module names
- `test_fixes_integration.py` - Updated to test correct entry points
- Test files - Reverted to use correct import structure for installation

The entry points issue has been resolved and the package should now install and run correctly.

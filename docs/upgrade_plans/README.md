# STL Listing Tool - Queue System Upgrade Plans

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive planning documents for adding a batch processing queue system to the STL Listing Tool. The upgrade will transform the application from single-file processing to a powerful batch processing system capable of handling multiple STL files with various rendering options, validation settings, and output formats.

## User Requirements Summary

The queue system will enable users to:

1. **File Selection**: Select multiple STL files or entire folders (with recursive scanning)
2. **Processing Options**: Configure what to render with checkboxes:
   - Image rendering
   - Size chart generation  
   - Video presentation (360° rotation)
   - Color variations
   - Validation checks with dropdown level selection
   - Custom background images
3. **Output Organization**: Select output folder with automatic per-STL subfolder organization
4. **Queue Management**: Full control over processing queue:
   - Start, pause, resume, and stop operations
   - View queue position and progress
   - Reorder jobs by priority
5. **Validation & Recovery**: 
   - Pre-validate all files before processing
   - Skip invalid files automatically
   - Save queue state and resume on restart
   - Check for missing outputs at completion

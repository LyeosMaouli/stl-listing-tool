# STL GUI Status - Queue System Integration

## ✅ RESOLVED: Queue System Integration

The issue with `stl-gui` not running with the queue system has been **completely resolved**. 

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Import Structure**: Fixed relative imports in `gui_batch.py` to work correctly with the entry point system
2. **Entry Points**: Updated `setup.py` to correctly reference `src.gui_batch:main`
3. **Drag-and-Drop Removal**: Completely removed drag-and-drop functionality as requested
4. **Single GUI**: `stl-gui` now launches the unified GUI that supports both single file and batch processing
5. **Dependencies**: Removed unnecessary `tkinterdnd2` dependency

### Current Status:

- ✅ **Queue System**: Fully integrated and functional
- ✅ **Single GUI**: Unified interface for both single and batch processing
- ✅ **Entry Point**: `stl-gui` command correctly configured
- ✅ **No Drag-and-Drop**: Clean interface with browse buttons only
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: No platform-specific dependencies

### How to Use:

1. **Install the package**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Launch GUI**:
   ```bash
   stl-gui
   ```

3. **GUI Features**:
   - **Single File Mode**: Select "Single File Processing" and use "Browse File..." button
   - **Batch Mode**: Select "Batch Processing" and use "Browse Folder..." button
   - **Queue Management**: In batch mode, access the "Batch Queue" tab for full control
   - **Real-time Progress**: See live updates of job progress and queue status

### Technical Details:

The queue system (`enhanced_job_manager.py`) is fully integrated with the GUI:
- Multi-threaded job execution
- Pause/resume functionality
- Error handling and recovery
- Session persistence
- Real-time progress tracking
- Observer pattern for UI updates

### Testing Results:

All core functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Import system works correctly
- ✅ Queue initialization successful
- ✅ GUI main function executes properly
- ✅ Job manager creates and shuts down cleanly
- ✅ Entry point simulation successful

The system is ready for production use with full queue system integration.

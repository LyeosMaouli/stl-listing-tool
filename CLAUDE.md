# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the `stl-listing-tool` project, designed to process STL files to help create listings (images, charts, video presentations).

## Current State

This repository is in the initial setup phase with only basic documentation files present:
- README.md: Basic project description
- LICENSE: Apache 2.0 license

## Development Commands

No build, test, or development commands are currently configured. The project structure and tooling are yet to be established.

## Architecture

The codebase architecture is not yet defined. Future development will need to establish:
- Programming language and framework choices
- Project structure and organization
- Build and dependency management systems
- Testing frameworks and strategies

## Next Steps for Development

When starting development, consider:
1. Choose appropriate technology stack for STL file processing
2. Set up build and dependency management (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Establish project structure with source directories
4. Configure testing and linting tools
5. Update this CLAUDE.md file with specific commands and architecture details
